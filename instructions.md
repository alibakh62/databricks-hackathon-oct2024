# AI Image Generation Expert (Stable Diffusion + ControlNet) for Custom Print Artwork

## Job Description

We‚Äôre building an AI-powered design engine that allows users to create custom artwork for a printed physical product using a bot assistant. These designs vary in style ‚Äî from photorealistic to illustrative, tattoo-inspired, graphic, or minimalist ‚Äî depending on the user‚Äôs creative direction.

We are looking for an expert in **Stable Diffusion + ControlNet** to help us build a generation pipeline that transforms structured prompts into both:
- a high-quality visual preview, and
- a flattened 2D print file that fits very specific physical constraints.

> **Important Note:**  
You will not be responsible for chatbot development.  
You will receive structured prompts directly from another system ‚Äî your job is to take those prompts and generate accurate artwork and mockups.

---

## What You‚Äôll Build

1. A complete Stable Diffusion + ControlNet image generation pipeline (local or hosted)
2. Image outputs that include:
   - A product mockup using our supplied 3D object base image (spherical)
   - A flattened 2D design file suitable for UV printing

---

## Design Constraints

All artwork must be strictly confined to a printable band that wraps around a sphere:

**Band Dimensions:**  
`134mm wide √ó 25mm tall`  
(Wrapping around a 42.67mm diameter spherical object)

**Artwork must:**
- Stay within the band boundaries  
- Be clean, centered, and undistorted  
- Be print-ready for a UV RIP software workflow (we‚Äôll define specs)

---

## Example Workflow

1. You receive a prompt like:

   > ‚ÄúA bold design with lightning bolts, flames, and the word ‚ÄòBEAST MODE‚Äô in heavy blackletter font.‚Äù

2. Your system:
   - Generates a photorealistic or stylized mockup of that design applied to the equator band of our product
   - Extracts the flattened design band (134mm √ó 25mm) as a separate high-resolution image (PNG or similar)

3. (Optional) You generate 4 variations in a 2x2 preview grid, numbered for user selection.

## Requirements

**Proven experience with:**
- Stable Diffusion 1.5 / 2.1 / XL  
- ControlNet with image masks or reference guides  

**Familiarity with:**
- Layout-constrained generation workflows  
- Product rendering and surface-aware design  
- Styles: photorealism, illustration, iconography, type-heavy designs  

**Ability to:**
- Extract flattened 2D print files from curved mockup outputs  
- Ensure spelling accuracy and print-safe alignment  

**Bonus:**
- Experience with AUTOMATIC1111 or ComfyUI  
- LoRA fine-tuning for consistent brand style output  
- Prior work with print-on-demand or UV direct-to-object workflows  

---

## Deliverables

- A fully functioning generation pipeline that accepts text prompts  
- Consistent design previews (mockups)  
- Flattened band output for printing (134mm √ó 25mm @ 300+ DPI)  
- Documentation and reusable templates  
- (Optional) 2x2 design variant generation  

---

## Budget

üí∞ **$2,000 ‚Äì $4,000**, depending on experience and scope  
Open to hourly or fixed-price structure with defined milestones.

---

## Timeline

We‚Äôre ready to start **immediately**.  
We‚Äôre targeting a **prototype-ready solution in 2‚Äì4 weeks.**

---

## To Apply

Please include:
- Samples of previous work with Stable Diffusion and layout constraints  
- Any experience with mockup-to-print pipelines  
- Your approach to building and automating this type of workflow
